Haskell syntax:

* GHCi tools
  * :reload
  * :reload!
  * :type
  * :info
* Ensure editor TAB spacing is turned OFF
* values, assignment
* type signatures `::` reads as *has the type*
  * The `->` in a type signature is *right-associative*
* functions are values
* functions take arguments
  * functions take *only one argument* but we approximate with spoken
    language
  * functions can be declared inline using *lambda expressions*
  * the `\` symbol in a lambda expression denotes a Greek lambda
* operators, beginning with non-alpha character, are in infix position by
  default
  * use in prefix position by surrounding with *(parentheses)*
* regular identifiers, beginning with alpha character, are in prefix position by
  default
  * use in infix position by surrounding with ``backticks``
* polymorphism
  * type variables *always* start with a lower-case character
* data types, declared using the `data` keyword
  * following the `data` keyword is the *data type name*
  * following the data type name are zero of more type variables
  * then `=` sign
  * data types have zero or more constructors
    * data type constructors start with an upper-case character, or colon `(:)`
  * following each constructor is a list of zero or more *constructor arguments*
  * between each constructor is a pipe symbol `(|)`
  * the `deriving` keyword gives us default implementations for some functions
    on that data type
  * when constructors appear on the left side of `=` we are *pattern-matching*
  * when constructors appear on the right side of `=` we are *constructing*
* type-classes
